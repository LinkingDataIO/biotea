We define RDFize as a verb, meaning (i) to generate an RDF representation of something that was originally in a different format and 
(ii) to convert or transform to RDF
in order to run the RDFizing process for metadata, structure, content and references
you will need:

https://github.com/biotea/biotea-rdfization f

once you have the jar file, just:

java -jar biotea_rdfization.jar -in ./pmc_nxml -out ./pmc_rdf -extension -onto AO -format XML -annotator ncbo -ontlyTA false
